# Sets in Lean, sheet 6 : pushforward and pullback

## Pushforward of a set along a map

If `f : X → Y` then given a subset `S : set X` of `X` we can push it
forward to make a subset `f(S) : set Y` of `Y`. The definition
of `f(S)` is `{y : Y | ∃ x : X, x ∈ S ∧ f x = y}`. 

However `f(S)` doesn't make sense in Lean, because `f` eats
terms of type `X` and not `S`, which has type `set X`. 
In Lean we use the notation `f '' S` for this. This is notation
for `set.image` and if you need any API for this, it's likely
to use the word `image`.

## Pullback of a set along a map

If `f : X → Y` then given a subset `T : set Y` of `Y` we can
pull it back to make a subset `f⁻¹(T) : set X` of `X`. The definition
of `f⁻¹(T)` is `{x : X | f x ∈ T}`.

However `f⁻¹(T)` doesn't make sense in Lean either, because
`⁻¹` is notation for `has_inv.inv`, whose type in Lean
is `α → α`. In other words, if `x` has a certain type, then
`x⁻¹` *must* have the same type. The notation was basically designed
for group theory. In Lean we use the notation `f ⁻¹' T` for this pullback.
This is notation for `set.preimage` and if you need any API for this,
it's likely to use the word `preimage`.

-- `library_search` will do this but see if you can do it yourself.
example : f '' S ⊆ T ↔ S ⊆ f ⁻¹' T := by sorry

-- Pushforward and pullback along the identity map don't change anything
-- pullback is not so hard
example : id ⁻¹' S = S := by sorry

-- pushforward is a little trickier. You might have to `ext x, split`.
example : id '' S = S := by sorry

-- Now let's try composition.
variable (Z : Type) (g : Y → Z) (U : Set Z)

-- preimage of preimage is preimage of comp
example : g ∘ f ⁻¹' U = f ⁻¹' (g ⁻¹' U) := by sorry

-- preimage of preimage is preimage of comp
example : g ∘ f '' S = g '' (f '' S) := by sorry
